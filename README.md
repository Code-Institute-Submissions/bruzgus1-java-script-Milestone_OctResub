- Devices:
    - MacBook Air 2013 (MacOS).
    - Iphone Xs Max (MacOS).
    - Iphone 11 (MacOS).
    - Ipad Pro (MacOS).
    - Samsung Galaxy A21s (Android).

    - Huawei p40 little jny-lx1 (Android).

- Browsers:
    - Brave Browser.
    - Google Chrome.
    - Safari.

## Bugs 

1. Errors in console on page load in Brave Browser, that does not happen on other browsers or in a private browse window

2. After getting the calculated answer the calculator breaks when you wanna calculate again, to fix this when the user clicks to clear the calculator, it reloads the entire page and sets the calculator back to square 1, fixing the issue

3. In Safari the calculator does everything on the left side instead of the right
